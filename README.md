# Analyses in R on correlation
The main analysis are written by Sara Johanne Asche in R-markdown and can be found ![here](Data Science.Rmd). These analysis includes plotting of boxplots, Spearman rank correlation tests, Shapiro-Wilk tests, and Wilcoxon pairwise tests. The matrix output from the Spearman analysis can be seen in the excelfiles marked either "p_valuecorrelation" + country name for p-value and "correlation" + country for the rho value. One example is the ![Rho correlation coefficient for Spain](correlationSpain.xlsc) as well as ![associated p-values](p_valcorrelationSpain.xlsx). 

# Analysis in Jupiter notebook on mortality shift
The analysis of the 21 day mortality shift are done by Anna Katharina Herrmann and written in Jupiter notebook. They can be accessed ![here](TEST_Countries.ipynb). One example of a 21 day shift in mortality can be seen for ![Germany after 21 days](df_Germany_after21days.csv).
